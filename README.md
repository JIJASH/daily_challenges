##Task 1: Numpy Matrix Ops
Problem: 📘 Problem Description:
You're given two 2D matrices A and B. Write a function to compute the matrix product C = A × B without using any of the following:
    @ operator
    np.dot()
    np.matmul()
Instead, use basic Python for loops and NumPy indexing to implement the multiplication manually.


##Task 2 : 🧠 Daily DSA Challenge: "Top K Frequent Words"
💡 Task:
Given a list of strings (words), return the k most frequent words, sorted by frequency (and alphabetically for ties).
📝 Input:
words = ["apple", "banana", "apple", "orange", "banana", "apple", "mango"]
k = 2
🎯 Expected Output:
["apple", "banana"]
Apple appears 3 times
Banana appears 2 times
Orange & Mango appear once
