Task 1: Numpy Matrix Ops
Problem: ðŸ“˜ Problem Description:

You're given two 2D matrices A and B. Write a function to compute the matrix product C = A Ã— B without using any of the following:
    @ operator
    np.dot()
    np.matmul()

Instead, use basic Python for loops and NumPy indexing to implement the multiplication manually.
